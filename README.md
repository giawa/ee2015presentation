# ee2015presentation
This is the code for a presentation that I giving at my local University.  The first presentation was made in 2014, and will be available on youtube shortly.  This presentation is meant to be an interactive demonstration of some of audio, digital and DSP course work.

This project emulates many types of PowerPoint slides, and could be re-themed very easily.  Checking the Slides/Common.cs codebase for all of the common elements used by the theme.
