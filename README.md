# ee2015presentation
This is the code for a presentation that I am giving at my local University.  This presentation is meant to be an interactive demonstration of some audio, digital and DSP course work.

This project emulates many types of PowerPoint slides, and could be re-themed very easily.  Check the presentation/Slides/Common.cs code for all of the common elements used by the theme.

## Use of Copyrighted Works
The presentation is set up to emulate a PowerPoint presentation, and uses some elements from a PowerPoint theme.  I own a full copy of PowerPoint, so I believe I am acting within my rights of using the PowerPoint theme in my own software as well (especially since this software is not being sold, etc).  Some of the pictures in the presentation have been obtained via Google, and are their respective rights holders maintain their copyright over those images.  Since this is open source and educational, I believe that I am acting within fair use laws.

If you are the copyright holder of an image, theme or other content of this presentation, please submit an issue to this Git repository to have your content removed.  Please provide proof that you are the copyright holder so that the process can be expeditious.

## Building the Project
